# Personal Website

## Project Overview
Using React and Sass, I am aiming to create a new personalize website. This website was long over due as the last `update` was back in Junior year of High School (2019). This time, I am highly inspired by Arknight's one page layout, and thought, hey, I should do something similar to theirs. There was no plan going to it, and hence no Figma design or anything.

## Technology Used
- React
- Javascript
- Sass/Css
- HTML/Jsx

## Future Plans
- [ ] **FINISHING**, the actual website.
- [ ] Modular for different size of website.
- [ ] DarkMode is what I want to add in the future. The priority of this update is at the very minimal, so I don't have to worry about much of this.

### Start React Project
