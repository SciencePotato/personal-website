# Personal Website

## Project Overview
Using React and Sass, I am aiming to create a new personalize website. This website was long over due as the last `update` was back in Junior year of High School (2019). This time, I am highly inspired by Arknight's one page layout, and thought, hey, I should do something similar to theirs.

## Future Plans
- [x] FINISHING, the actual website.
- [x] Modular for different size of website.
- [x] DarkMode is what I want to add in the future. The priority of this update is at the very minimal, so I don't have to worry about much of this.

### SASS Watch
`Sass --watch src/assets/Sass:src/assets/Css

### Deployment
`npm run deploy`
